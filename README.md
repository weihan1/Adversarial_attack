# Adversarial_attack
Steps:
1. Create your own dataset of essays with various topics.
2. Use api_dataset.py to generate AI-generated essays based on the same topics of your dataset.
3. Then, you can use main_training.py to train a BERT model to learn to classify whether a piece of text is written by AI or by a human.
4. Finally, run main.py and input an essay generated by ChatGPT and watch the modifications that are done.

# Note:
The adversarial attack module is using TextAttack (https://textattack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the AI-generated process is using the OPENAI API (https://openai.com).
